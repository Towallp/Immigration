Loading necessary libraries below:

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
```

First get the url for the file you want, and download it, ideally to a folder.  In this case, a 'downloads2' folder was created.
I got the URL from the www.dhs.gov website and noted that it was a zip file. 

```{r}
download.file("https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/LPR2006_0.zip",
             destfile = "downloads/lpr2006.zip")
download.file("https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/YRBK%202016%20LPR%20Excel%20Final_0.zip",
             destfile = "downloads/lpr2016.zip")
```


Get a list of the files in the zip, which allows you to see the file name to insert below in the unzip command.

```{r}
unzip("downloads/lpr2006.zip", list = TRUE)
unzip("downloads/lpr2016.zip", list = TRUE)
```

Unzipped Table 6 for both datasets.  First dataset is from 1997 to 2006; Second dataset is from 2007 to 2016.

```{r}
unzip("downloads/lpr2006.zip", exdir = "downloads/unzipped", files = "Table 06D.xls")
unzip("downloads/lpr2016.zip", exdir = "downloads/unzipped", files = "YRBK 2016 LPR Excel Final/fy2016_table6.xls")

```

So now table6 is at "downloads2/unzipped/Table 06D.xls" and downloads2/unzipped/YRBK 2016 LPR Excel Final/fy2016_table6.xls. Created two variables for both unzipped files, path1 and path2.

```{r}

path1 <- "~/downloads/unzipped/Table 06D.xls"
path2 <- "~/downloads/unzipped/YRBK 2016 LPR Excel Final/fy2016_table6.xls"

```

First, I'm reading in the excel file(.xls) that contains files from 1997 to 2006 using the variable name, path1. Then, read in the 2nd, excel file containing records from 2007 to 2016.

Skipped the first. three rows and converted all "D" strings to 'NA'

Tip: Reading the help file for readxl (?read_excel)

```{r}
tableSix_1997to2006 <- read_excel(path1, na ="D", skip = 3)
tableSix_2007to2016 <- read_excel(path2, na ="D", skip = 3)

```

Merging two data tables together; 1st dataset is from 1997 to 2006 and 2nd dataset is from 2007 to 2016; however, still have multiple duplicate rows even though I have 'no.dups=TRUE' below.


```{r}
myfulldata_1 <- merge(x = tableSix_1997to2006 , y = tableSix_2007to2016, sort = F, no.dups = T)

```

Last step eliminated all duplicate rows from dataset one, 1997 to 2006 by creating the 'filtered_df' and then, deleted the duplicate rows from the 2nd dataset, 2007 to 2016 by creating 'filtered_df2'.

```{r}
filtered_df <- myfulldata_1[!duplicated(myfulldata_1$`1997`),]
filtered_df2 <- filtered_df[!duplicated(filtered_df$`2007`) ,]

```

Using lapply function to change all -'s dashes in the dataset to 0s (only years 2007-2016 for the "Asylees" row had dashes)

```{r}

filtered_df2[2:21] <- lapply(filtered_df2[2:21], function(col) as.character( gsub("-$|\\,", "0", col) ) )

```

Using lapply function to change the class for all the years from "character" to "numeric" , 2:21 representing column 2 through 21.

```{r}
ix <- 2:21
filtered_df2[ix] <- lapply(filtered_df2[ix], as.numeric)

```
